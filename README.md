## AWS SAM Application for Managing Real Estate Financing

This is a sample application to demonstrate how to build an application on AWS Serverless Envinronment using the
AWS SAM, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.
It also uses the DynamoDBMapper ORM structure to map Financing items in a DynamoDB table to a RESTful API for managing real estate financing.


## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with at least PowerUser permission
* Java SE Development Kit 8 installed
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [SAM CLI](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
* [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies

We use `maven` to install our dependencies and package our application into a JAR file:

```bash
mvn install
```

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda Java runtime accepts either a zip file or a standalone JAR file - We use the latter in
this example. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and
dependencies:

Firstly, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we
deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to
create one:

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME=repo-demo-financing
aws s3 mb s3://$BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket $BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name real-estate-financing \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name sam-orderHandler \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```
